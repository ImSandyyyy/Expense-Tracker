### **1. Layout Idea**
- **Header:** A simple title like "Budget Tracker"  
- **Budget Summary Section:** Displays total budget, remaining budget, and spent amount  
- **Expense Input Section:**  
  - A field for entering the expense name  
  - A field for entering the expense amount  
  - A button to add expenses  
- **Expense List:** A list showing all added expenses with their amounts  
- **Footer (Optional):** Basic copyright or credits  

### **2. Features to Add**
✅ **Set Initial Budget** – Let users enter their total budget  
✅ **Add Expenses** – Users can input expenses with names and amounts  
✅ **Update Remaining Budget** – Dynamically calculate and display remaining balance  
✅ **Delete Expenses** – Option to remove an expense  
✅ **Categorization (Optional)** – Add categories like "Food," "Bills," "Entertainment"  
✅ **Storage (Optional)** – Use `localStorage` to save data even after refresh  
✅ **Visuals (Optional)** – Add a simple pie chart or progress bar to track spending <!-- Library --> 

### **3. Design Inspiration**
- Keep it **minimal and clean**  
- Use **colors to differentiate budget/expenses** (e.g., green for remaining, red for spent)  
- Use simple icons for better UX
